Real-Time Solder Detection on Jboxes via YOLOv8 and Hikrobot Vision Cameras Integration
This project encompasses the integration of YOLOv8 OpenCV object detection algorithms with the Hikrobot Vision Cameras SDK, aimed at real-time monitoring through USB3 connectivity.
The system is engineered for live detection of solders on Jboxes, ensuring precise and immediate feedback, thus aiding in maintaining quality control standards within an automated or semi-automated production environment.
